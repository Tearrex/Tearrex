### Hey there 👋
My name is Anthony and I'm a *huge* tech enthusiast. I love coding my ideas into reality and gaming my pain out of it. My passion for computers has flourished from boredom and curiosity over the years. I toyed with website builders as a preteen and eventually discovered the joy of creation with HTML/CSS/JS. Web development is pretty cool, I plan on pursuing a career with it and maybe dabble in some IT fields like Networking—because it's a fascinating concept to me : )
- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... deploying a REST API with AWS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... the MERN stack
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... Android development!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... Kotlin & Redux
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can't sleep knowing I have runtime errors to fix...
  
When I'm not coding, I like to
- 🎮 Play Battlefield 1
- 🍃 Watch the trees rustle
- 💻 Think about how I could be coding

Feel free to reach out for a quick chat or game night 🦉
