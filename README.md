### Hey there 👋
My name is Anthony. I'm a tech enthusiast that loves coding ideas into reality. My passion for computers has flourished from boredom and curiosity during my childhood. I toyed with website builders in highschool and progressively got more hands-on with HTML/CSS/JS. Since then I have been nurturing my webdev niche for my career trajectory, and have recently gained industry experience in the field designing customer-facing apps for a business as well as provisioning the underlying infrastructure involved.

I am also interested in Network/System administration roles and have been studying cloud technologies for the AWS Solutions Architect cert.
